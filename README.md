# Data Cleaning and Analysis of Pittsburgh's Revenues and Expenses
## About

I conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on Pittsburgh's revenues and expenses to improve the accuracy of the financial data and gain meaningful insights. By correcting errors and inconsistencies, I ensured that the data reflects the city's true financial situation. The analysis helped identify key trends and patterns, which are essential for understanding financial performance and guiding resource allocation. This work supports more informed decision-making and better financial management for the city.
